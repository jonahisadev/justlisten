			Just Listen is a service for musicians to create a one-stop shop for their music.
			There's so many different platforms for listeners that it's hard to market to 
			all of them at once. Just Listen solves this problem. Point your listeners to your
			Just Listen profile, where you can put your entire discography, and never have a 
			listener looking around for your music again.
		</p>

		<p style="margin-left: 20%; font-size: 14pt; width: 60%;">
			When a listener selects an album, EP, or single from your discography, they will
			be taken to a landing page that contains a link to your music on every platform 
			you've provided. Once selected, Just Listen will remember which platform they
			listen to. The next time they visit that landing page, they will be automatically
			taken to the last platform they chose.
		</p>

		<p style="margin-left: 20%; font-size: 14pt; width: 60%;">
			What this means, is you can share your release via Just Listen, and any listeners
			that have used Just Listen before will be taken straight to their favorite platform!
			No need to share SoundCloud links for your SoundCloud listeners and iTunes links for
			your iTunes fans. Share one link and all your fans can listen instantly!
		</p>

		<p style="margin-left: 20%; font-size: 14pt; width: 60%;">
			What sets Just Listen apart from other services like it, is your profile page. Your fans
			can visit your Just Listen profile for all your music. If they've used Just Listen before,
			they'll go directly to their favorite platform. It's like having your iTunes, Spotify, <i>and</i>
			SoundCloud profile all in one place!
		</p>

		<p style="margin-left: 20%; font-size: 14pt; width: 60%;">
			Just Listen is entirely funded and run by a college student trying to
			better the music community. If you would like to
